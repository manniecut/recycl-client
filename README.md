# Recycl. - A New Way to Recycl.

## Description

Recycl is an app that helps the user find proper ways to recycle their materials. It provides maps of local spots that may take certain materials, and has the framework for a scheduling in-person pickups. NOTE: This is just a demonstration of my capabilities, and no one will show up in the real world to pick up your stuff!
